The first thing that happens is users will submit tickets by filling out the form. It will ask for their email address, full name, phone number and the Help Topic. Once they select a help topic Ticket details will pop up, here they can describe the issue in more details. Once they fill this out they click on Create ticket.

As a Help Desk Agent we observe the tickets properties, we can aslo set priorities if any need to be changed. For example we set the SLA to Sev-A, we updated the Help Topics from "Report a problem" to "Report a problem/Business Critical Outage". We also assigned the ticket to the Online Banking Team.

</p>
<p>
As an agent who is a part of the Online Banking Team we can go in and assign the ticket to ourselves. We can post replies and if possible get in contact with the user that submitted the ticket to get more information/details on the problem. Once we know more information we can work on the ticket and post replies as we go to keep the team, user who submitted the ticket updated. Once the problem is solved we can set the ticket to resolved and close the ticket.
